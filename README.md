# Towers of Hanoi and Sliding Puzzle Game
This application uses routing in Angular to include "links" to two different games, Towers of Hanoi and a Sliding Puzzle game. This application also includes Angular's CDKDrag library to add the dragging and dropping effects of each game. This application was originally created for my web programming class, however I continue to polish and update the logic and user interface.

## Angular CLI

Running the Application
1. Install Node.js on local machine, version 22.17.0 or later
2. Create/navigate to a directory you want the repository to be in
3. Clone the repository
4. Navigate to the repository directory (should contain "src" folder, but make sure to not be inside the "src" folder)
5. Open up a terminal if you haven't already, still making sure you are in the repository directory
6. Run the command "npm install" for Node Modules
7. Run the command "ng serve" to start the application
